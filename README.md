# React Blog Site ([View Blog](https://patricknausha.github.io/blog-site-react-exercise))

This project was created as a coding exercise.

## Overview

### Features

The site supports the following operations

- Create an Account and authenticate against protected API endpoints using JWT
- Create, edit and delete posts
- Comment on posts
- Browse and read blog posts and comments from other users

### Non-features

In order to reduce project scope and support deployment to GitHub pages, the following features are intentionally omitted.

- Full URL-based routing.
  - This project uses a hash-based routing system. This antiquated single-page application routing approach uses the URL fragment (e.g. `/blog-site-react-exercise/#/posts/create` instead of just `/blog-site-react-exercise/posts/create`)
- Persistent authentication
  - Since I wanted to deploy this app easily to GitHub pages, there's no server code. In a commercial context, this application would likely use a reverse proxy in front of its APIs to transform the JWT Authorization header to and from an `HttpOnly` cookie.
  - I could use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) or a non-`HttpOnly` cookie to persist the authentication JWT, but neither of these practices are very secureâ€”an authentication JWT in `localStorage` or a JS-accessible cookie can be stolen in the presence of an XSS attack, compromised browser plugin, etc.
- Sever Side Rendering
- Error feedback
  - Error feedback is extremely limited.
  - If the user provides bad input, e.g. invalid password, either a generic error message or no error message will be shown.
  - Operations that fail due to server errors may silently fail or crash the page.
- Request cancellation and deduplication.
  - It is possible that inflight `fetch` requests may trigger state mutations after a component is unmounted. This may result in error messages.
  - Future features could mutate state in ways that trigger duplicate `fetch` requests for the same data.
- Proper 404 pages
  - If a post is missing or a URL is otherwise invalid, you may see an eternal loading indicator.

## Developing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
